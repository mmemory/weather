# Weather App

This app receives data from the www.openweathermap.org API. Users have the ability to search for current weather data by zip code. A user can then save a snapshot of that location's weather at that time.

## Running the App
This app uses AngularJS, NodeJS, and MongoDB. Bower is also necessary to set up the front end libraries.

To run the app: download the repository files, make sure MongoDB is running, and run the following commands in the command terminal from the root folder:

````bash
npm install
````

````bash
bower install
````

````bash
npm start
````

The app should start running on the port specified in the terminal window.
